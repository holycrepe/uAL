# The file provides mapping between Git users and known TFS user
# unique names. The Git user has to be represented as it appears
# in Git commits, including the user name and e-mail address.
# The TFS user has to be represented either as DOMAIN\account
# (for on-premises TFS) or as Windows Live ID (for hosted TFS).

# The section contains mapping between Git users and TFS users.
# Add new mappings to this section as needed. Only this section
# is parsed when the file is used in a check-in command.

# The section contains Git user names found in commits that cannot
# be mapped to TFS users automatically. You should provide mapping
# for these names or remove the --keep-author option from the
# check-in command. This section is not parsed when the file is
# used in a check-in command, you have to move resolved mapping
# to the [mapping] section
